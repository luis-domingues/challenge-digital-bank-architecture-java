## digital bank architecture

Repository intended for the challenge proposed by [DIO](https://www.dio.me/en) regarding OOP in Java.

Also, this repository is based on [Banking App](https://github.com/luis-domingues/banking-app) but in a simpler way in order to understand a little about the architecture of a banking application.

### Description

This project simulates the basic operations of a digital bank. The banking context is used to explore the pillars of object-oriented programming, allowing participants to:

- Develop their **abstraction** skills by reproducing the provided solution;
- Implement their own enhancements and improvements to customize and expand the project.

### Concepts used:

- **Abstraction:** Representation of entities like `Customer`, `Account`, `Checking Account`, and `Savings Account`;
- **Encapsulation:** Controlling access to class attributes and methods;
- **Inheritance:** Creation of `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` subclasses from the base class `Account`;
- **Polymorphism:** Overriding methods to adapt behavior based on the account type.

### Key Features

- Creating accounts for customers (checking and savings);
- Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts;
- Displaying account statements.
